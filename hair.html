<h1>Why is hair so important to us?</h1>

<p>  We often see our hair as a reflection of our identity. Theres a personal relationship with hair and our self-esteem.
   Many women feel that a bad hair day equals a bad day.
   The feeling of empowerment and beauty you feel when you have a bomb hair day is irreplaceable.
   Your feel as if you can take on anything, its liberating. Hair is one of things women have had control over since the begining of time.
   We use hair to express ourselves; whether its because of a change in your life or because your just bored.
   Hair is a multibillion-dollar industry and we know why. Hair is confidence.</p>

<h2>There is no set "normal"</h2>

  <p> Literally everyone is different, even down to your cells. Like seriously dont compare yourself to others...you may see similarities but never the exact same.
   Your difference in characteristics should be empowered because it belongs to you and nobody else. Celebrate your uniqueness-its a good thing! </p>
